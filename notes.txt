When your token expires, it doesnt give me the alert i wanted to show,
it ends up in the catch err => and gives a json syntax error instead of
the message mentioning your token may have expired, etc.

BUGS
------
-bug when clicking a bunch of times on a student (i think only happens
on students that have been previously moved?)

-long names will overflow student columns, truncate the names

-cant just add one more classroom if you accidently put 3 and u wanted 4.. it wont
error out but it doesnt do anything after trying to upload the student
data after adding an additional classroom.

Features:
----------
-show parent participation or other "ranked" attribute numbers next to
student went clicked on that particular "non-binary" stat

-stat should be highlighted when clicked so user remembers what stat they had
highlighted...if u click again on a highlightable state, remove the highlight.
    ...also think add aggregate highlights (male and special ed, etc.)

-highlight boys blue and girls green or something like that, so we can
get rid of the males/females attribute (MAYBE)

-Add student cards  and manual student additions  (Big Feature)

-Add "bank" to hold students when a user is unsure where to move them
  (..add another "table" called unknowns or something that is filled with
  10 or so empty slots...this way we can easily swap them with an empty slot
  in this case.)

Other:
------
ADD README, with demo video and setup instructions.

-Show and hide  Save/Retrieve classrooms based on login

you have an updateStatsView method in classrooms manager that should
be moved over to view builder appropriately.

Remember to add disclaimer or something to mention how to setup
excel file now that you know the format for binary items/ranking items/name/sex

keep checking for break down of functions/methods to make  smaller and more
concise / additional refactors.
