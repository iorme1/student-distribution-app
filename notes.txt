-error handling for having incorrect "main metric attribute" not on excel
file ... tricky because app wont have the excel file yet...will have to show
up soon after they import the file, and error must handle gracefully.
Need to have form checks that validate unique classroom names, all fields
filled out, etc.

 in the classroom form handler you need to validate the inputs to make sure
 there isnt identical names for classrooms and that maxcapacity is filled
 out.

 -cant just add one more classroom if you accidently put 3 and u wanted 4.. it wont
 error out but it doesnt do anything after trying to upload the student
 data after adding an additional classroom.


**** stat should be highlighted as well so user remembers what stat they had
highlighted, also add aggregate highlights (male and special ed, etc.)***
  ...also if u click again on a highlightable state, remove the highlight.

Add "bank" to hold students when a user is unsure where to move them


Other:
------
ADD README, with demo video and setup instructions.

-Show and hide  Save/Retrieve classrooms based on login

you have an updateStatsView method in classrooms manager that should
be moved over to view builder appropriately.

Remember to add disclaimer or something to mention how to setup
excel file now that you know the format for binary items/ranking items/name/sex

keep checking for break down of functions/methods to make  smaller and more
concise / additional refactors.
