API request / JWT related:
---------------------------
-DEFINITELY add a clear loading icon for the requests that take longer/because ur heroku
server sleeps. Maybe pay for this one soon?

-User should automatically get logged in after creating an account

Other priorities:
-----------------
**** stat should be highlighted as well so user remembers what stat they had
highlighted, also add aggregate highlights (male and special ed, etc.)***
  ...also if u click again on a highlightable state, remove the highlight.

Add "bank" to hold students when a user is unsure where to move them

error handling for having incorrect "main metric attribute" not on excel
file ... tricky because app wont have the excel file yet...will have to show
up soon after they import the file, and error must handle gracefully.
Need to have form checks that validate unique classroom names, all fields
filled out, etc.


Other:
--------
ADD README, with demo video and setup instructions.

-Show and hide  Save/Retrieve classrooms based on login

you have an updateStatsView method in classrooms manager that should
be moved over to view builder appropriately.

Remember to add disclaimer or something to mention how to setup
excel file now that you know the format for binary items/ranking items/name/sex

keep checking for break down of functions/methods to make  smaller and more
concise / additional refactors.


Browser Compatibility / OS Compatibility:
---------------------
Chrome -> works fine on both windows and mac
FireFox -> works fine on both windows and mac
Safari -> everything works fine except Minor bug on stats display...
          ..some overlapping of text for some reason. unique to safari so far.

Internet Explorer Bugs:
-----------------------
onkeyup or something not working, classrooms not showing up on form
when I type in number of classrooms
