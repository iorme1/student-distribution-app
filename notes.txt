API request / JWT related:
---------------------------

-long names will overflow student columns, truncate the names

-add background design and style student data square nicer and more to the right.
 -cant just add one more classroom if you accidently put 3 and u wanted 4.. it wont
 error out but it doesnt do anything after trying to upload the student
 data after adding an additional classroom.

-stat should be highlighted when clicked so user remembers what stat they had
highlighted...if u click again on a highlightable state, remove the highlight.
    ...also think add aggregate highlights (male and special ed, etc.)

-Add "bank" to hold students when a user is unsure where to move them
  (..add another "table" called unknowns or something that is filled with
  10 or so empty slots...this way we can easily swap them with an empty slot
  in this case.)

Other:
------
ADD README, with demo video and setup instructions.

-Show and hide  Save/Retrieve classrooms based on login

you have an updateStatsView method in classrooms manager that should
be moved over to view builder appropriately.
