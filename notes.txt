Currently have hacky "attributes" situation. We have state.attributeTotals
and just general "attributes" array. Used interchangeably right now with
hacky conditionals... fix this up.

also should refactor the setting up of attributes to lower case everything
right from the start, so we don't have to check later in the code.

Figure out how to setup an "order" of operations for a user to
make for better user experience, make it very clear and only
give option for creating classrooms FIRST, THEN show import
students button

going to need to throw errors and use some kind of sweet alert
to let user know that the attribute chosen to organize their
students by was not input correctly, etc.  going to need to find
all places where user error from mistyping anything can be saved
and displayed properly to the user.
