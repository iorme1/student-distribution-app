FINISH breaking down functions in view builder file, still have some
super long element creation functions

you have an updateStatsView method in classrooms manager that should
be moved over to view builder appropriately.

decide if u want a standard excel document attribute for "name"...
this leads into other questions about how specific the format needs
to be without being TOO strict.

add feature to click on certain classroom stats like: males, females,
lowReader, special Ed, etc and highlight all those students in that
classroom.

Need to have form checks that validate unique classroom names, all fields
filled out, etc.

Figure out how to setup an "order" of operations for a user to
make for better user experience, make it very clear and only
give option for creating classrooms FIRST, THEN show import
students button

going to need to throw errors and use some kind of sweet alert
to let user know that the attribute chosen to organize their
students by was not input correctly, etc.  going to need to find
all places where user error from mistyping anything can be saved
and displayed properly to the user.
